# Biography page

I'll be honest. I haven't had much time to think of a good homework exercise. 
So I want you to make a biography page. 

You are free to add any content to your page but it should include at least the following:
* Headers
* Paragraphs
* Unordered lists
* Ordered lists 
* Images

Also, pick a random tag that you don't know, study it then use it in your page.

Name your page biography.html and add it to the root folder of this repository.

P.S. Understanding how to use github is part of this homework :)
